C# Best Practices for Unity Game Development

<Project Structure & Organization>

Organize scripts clearly: Use folders like Scripts/Core, Scripts/UI, Scripts/Gameplay, etc.

One class per file: Makes searching and refactoring much easier.

Namespace your code: Prevent naming collisions and clarify ownership (e.g., namespace MyGame.Player).

<Unity-Specific Best Practices>

Avoid using Update() unnecessarily: Heavy use of Update() can cause performance issues. Use events, coroutines, or InvokeRepeating() where possible.

Cache component lookups: Use GetComponent in Awake() or Start() and store the reference.

Use FixedUpdate() for physics logic, Update() for regular per-frame logic, and LateUpdate() for camera or follow adjustments.

Prefer SerializeField over public fields: Keep fields private but visible in the Inspector for designer-friendly tweaking.

<Code Quality>

Follow C# naming conventions:

PascalCase for public methods and properties.

camelCase for private fields.

_underscore prefix for private serialized fields (optional but common in Unity).

Use properties instead of public fields when possible for better encapsulation.

Write self-explanatory methods: A method should do one clear thing.

<Performance Tips>

Use object pooling for frequently spawned/destroyed objects.

Avoid frequent Find() or string-based tag searches in performance-critical code.

Minimize garbage generation: Avoid frequent allocations (e.g., new lists in Update), and use StringBuilder for heavy string operations.

<Testing & Debugging>

Use assertions and custom debug logs to catch unexpected states early.

Create debug-only utilities using #if UNITY_EDITOR or DEBUG directives.

Write editor tools (custom inspectors or scriptable objects) to streamline content setup.

<Serialization & ScriptableObjects>

Use ScriptableObjects for config data: Great for settings, data-driven designs, and decoupling systems.

Be cautious with [Serializable] classes: Changing field orders or removing fields can break saved data.

<Collaboration & Documentation>

Write XML or summary comments on public APIs and core systems.

Leave TODO/FIXME notes clearly marked so they’re easy to find later.

Commit often and use descriptive commit messages.

<Common Pitfalls to Avoid>

Don't rely on OnDestroy() for saving data — it may not run in all shutdown cases.

Avoid heavy logic in constructors; Unity lifecycle methods (Awake, Start, etc.) are preferred.

Watch out for hidden allocations (e.g., using LINQ in hot paths).
